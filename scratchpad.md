# Numerai Tournament System - Development Tracker

## ACTUAL PROJECT STATUS ANALYSIS (September 12, 2025)

**System Version**: v0.8.1 (tagged as "production ready")
**Reality Check**: System has significant gaps between claimed completion and actual specification compliance

## CRITICAL FINDINGS FROM SPECIFICATION ANALYSIS

### ‚ùå MAJOR IMPLEMENTATION GAPS IDENTIFIED

#### 1. **TabNet Neural Network Model - COMPLETELY REMOVED** üî¥
- **Status**: Explicitly removed from codebase as "incomplete placeholder"
- **Specification Requirement**: TabNet model was documented in specs as a key neural network option
- **Current State**: Only MLP and ResNet models implemented

#### 5. **Authentication System Status - UNCLEAR** ‚ùì
- **Startup Issue**: TUI dashboard startup cannot be tested due to timeout/hanging
- **Credential Validation**: Cannot verify if authentication actually works in practice
- **API Integration**: May have underlying connectivity issues preventing startup

### ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING IMPLEMENTATIONS

#### 1. **Machine Learning Pipeline - COMPREHENSIVE** ‚úÖ
- **Models Available**: XGBoost, LightGBM, EvoTrees, CatBoost, MLP, ResNet
- **Multi-Target Support**: V4 (single) and V5 (multi-target) predictions implemented
- **Feature Engineering**: Neutralization, interaction constraints, feature groups
- **Ensemble Management**: Weighted prediction combining
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Bayesian, grid, and random search
- **Callback System**: Real-time training progress tracking

#### 2. **Core Infrastructure - SOLID** ‚úÖ
- **API Client**: GraphQL integration with retry logic
- **Data Processing**: Memory-efficient DataFrame operations
- **Database**: SQLite persistence for predictions and metadata
- **Logging**: Thread-safe centralized logging
- **Configuration**: TOML-based configuration management

#### 3. **TUI Panel System - BASIC FUNCTIONALITY** ‚úÖ
- **Core Panels**: Model performance, staking, predictions, events, system status
- **Styling**: Color-coded panels with appropriate icons
- **Real-time Updates**: Asynchronous data refresh
- **Layout**: Basic panel arrangement (though not 6-column grid as specified)

## PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

### üî¥ **CRITICAL PRIORITY (Blocking Production Use)**

#### 1. **Fix GPU Metal Acceleration Scalar Indexing Issues**
- **Problem**: All GPU operations fail with scalar indexing errors
- **Solution Required**: Rewrite GPU correlation and ensemble functions to avoid scalar access
- **Files**: `/src/gpu/metal_acceleration.jl` lines 520-535
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
- **Impact**: Essential for M4 Max performance optimization

#### 2. **Resolve Test Suite Timeout Issues**
- **Problem**: Tests cannot complete, making verification impossible
- **Investigation Needed**: Identify hanging operations (likely GPU/API related)
- **Solution**: Fix underlying issues causing timeouts
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 days
- **Impact**: Cannot validate system reliability

#### 3. **Fix TUI Dashboard Startup Issues**
- **Problem**: Dashboard hangs on startup, cannot test functionality
- **Root Cause**: Likely authentication or API connectivity issues
- **Solution**: Debug startup sequence, add timeout handling
- **Estimated Time**: 1 day
- **Impact**: Core user interface unusable

### üü° **HIGH PRIORITY (Missing Specification Features)**

#### 4. **Implement TabNet Neural Network Model**
- **Requirement**: Advanced attention-based model for tabular data
- **Implementation**: Complete TabNet architecture with attention mechanism
- **Files**: Add to `/src/ml/neural_networks.jl`
- **Estimated Time**: 3-4 weeks (as noted in existing comments)
- **Impact**: Missing key neural network capability from specs

#### 5. **Complete TUI Dashboard Specification Compliance**
- **Missing Features**:
  - 6-column grid layout system
  - Advanced interactive controls (model selection, details view)
  - Model creation wizard (`/new` command)
  - Enhanced command system (`/train`, `/submit`, `/stake`)
- **Files**: `/src/tui/dashboard.jl`, `/src/tui/dashboard_commands.jl`
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 weeks
- **Impact**: User experience not meeting specification requirements

### üü¢ **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Enhancement and Polish)**

#### 6. **Enhance Error Handling and Recovery**
- **Current**: Basic error logging exists
- **Needed**: Graceful degradation, automatic recovery, enhanced diagnostics
- **Impact**: System stability improvements

#### 7. **Performance Optimization**
- **Memory Management**: Optimize large dataset handling
- **Thread Utilization**: Better CPU core utilization
- **Caching**: Implement intelligent caching strategies

#### 8. **Documentation and Examples**
- **Current**: Basic examples exist
- **Needed**: Comprehensive user guides, API documentation
- **Impact**: User adoption and development efficiency

## ACTUAL SYSTEM STATUS: NOT PRODUCTION READY

**Assessment**: Despite v0.8.1 tag and claims of production readiness, the system has several critical blockers:

1. **GPU acceleration broken** (core feature for M4 Max)
2. **Tests cannot complete** (reliability unverified)
3. **TUI dashboard won't start** (primary user interface)
4. **Missing key specification features** (TabNet, advanced TUI)

**Confidence Level**: **LOW** - System needs significant work before production use

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Fix GPU scalar indexing issues (highest impact)
2. Resolve test suite timeouts (essential for validation)
3. Debug and fix TUI startup problems (user interface critical)
4. Implement missing specification features (TabNet, enhanced TUI)

**Time to Production Ready**: Estimated 4-6 weeks of focused development

## DEVELOPMENT NOTES

- **Test Coverage**: Cannot be verified due to timeout issues
- **GPU Support**: Apple Metal integration exists but has critical bugs
- **Neural Networks**: MLP and ResNet work, TabNet removed as incomplete
- **API Integration**: GraphQL client implemented but connectivity issues exist
- **Configuration**: Comprehensive TOML-based configuration system working

The previous scratchpad significantly overstated the system's readiness. While the core ML pipeline is solid and many components are well-implemented, critical infrastructure issues prevent actual production deployment.
