Your job is to create a production-ready Julia application following the specifications in the reference documents in @spec.

Follow the @scratchpad.md and choose the most important thing. Before making changes search codebase (don't assume not implemented) using subagents. You may use up to 100 parallel subagents for all operations but only 1 subagent for build/tests of Julia.

Make a commit and push your changes after every single file edit. You will need to write and run end to end and unit tests for the project. After implementing functionality or resolving problems, run the tests for that unit of code that was improved.

Use @scratchpad.md as a scratchpad for your work. Store long term plans and todo lists there.

Use @.env for any env variables like secrets.
