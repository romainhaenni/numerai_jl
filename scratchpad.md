# Numerai Tournament System - Implementation Status

## Project Status: STABLE v0.1.7 ✅

### Recently Completed (Critical Production Fixes)
1. ✅ Fixed UTC timezone handling across entire codebase
2. ✅ Fixed tournament schedule (Tuesday-Saturday per Numerai specs)
3. ✅ Added submission window validation (60hr weekend, 30hr daily)
4. ✅ Implemented MMC (Meta Model Contribution) local calculation
5. ✅ Implemented TC (True Contribution) local calculation
6. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with 599 test cases across 9 test suites
7. ✅ All tests currently passing (42 end-to-end tests + unit tests)
8. ✅ Full ML pipeline with XGBoost, LightGBM, and EvoTrees integration

## Immediate Priorities

### Critical Issues (None Found)
- No critical bugs or blocking issues identified
- All core functionality operational
- Test suite passing without failures

### Enhancement Opportunities

#### High Priority
1. **NMR Staking Write Operations**
   - **File**: `/src/api/client.jl`
   - **Status**: Read-only stake information functional (lines 458-513)
   - **Enhancement**: Add stake placement/modification API endpoints
   - **Impact**: Currently view-only, manual staking required via web UI

2. **CLI Integration Testing**
   - **Gap**: Command-line argument parsing not covered in test suite
   - **Risk**: CLI interface changes could break without detection

#### Medium Priority
3. **Default Model Configuration Enhancement**
   - **File**: `/src/NumeraiTournament.jl` lines 54-57
   - **Current**: Empty model array in default config
   - **Enhancement**: Provide sensible default model configurations

4. **TUI Model Details Panel**
   - **File**: `/src/tui/dashboard.jl` around lines 865-867
   - **Enhancement**: Interactive model details view (Enter key navigation)

#### Low Priority
5. **Advanced Features**
   - Automatic earnings reinvestment system
   - Enhanced reputation scoring algorithms
   - Proactive stake burn warning system
   - Full MLJ.jl framework integration
   - TUI wizard parameter adjustment with arrow keys

## Completed Features ✅
- ✅ UTC timezone handling (CRITICAL FIX)
- ✅ Correct tournament schedule (CRITICAL FIX)
- ✅ Submission window validation (CRITICAL FIX)
- ✅ MMC/TC local calculations
- ✅ V5 "Atlas" dataset support
- ✅ All file format handling
- ✅ Era-based organization
- ✅ Multiple targets support
- ✅ Feature neutralization
- ✅ All ML model integrations
- ✅ All 5 TUI panels
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage

## Assessment Summary

**Current State**: System is STABLE and TOURNAMENT READY at v0.1.7. All critical timing, scheduling, and calculation issues resolved. Core ML functionality complete with local MMC/TC calculations.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - Ready for production tournament participation
**Test Coverage**: 599 test cases across comprehensive test suite, all passing
**Dependencies**: 27 packages, all up-to-date and stable
**Critical Path**: No blocking issues identified

**Next Steps**: 
- Continue tournament participation with current stable version
- Optional enhancements can be developed in feature branches
- Monitor for any issues during live tournament usage
