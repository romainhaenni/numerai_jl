# Numerai Tournament System - Development Tracker

## âœ… RECENTLY COMPLETED (v0.3.3):

### 1. **Critical Neural Network Fixes** âœ…
   - âœ… Fixed method overwriting error in dashboard.jl (duplicate add_event! functions)
   - âœ… Resolved neural network module function call inconsistencies
   - âœ… Fixed model struct field references for save/load operations
   - âœ… Package compilation and testing now working properly

### 2. **Configuration Management** âœ…
   - âœ… Created config.toml with API credentials template
   - âœ… Tournament configuration properly setup
   - âœ… Development/testing environment configuration working


## ðŸ”„ HIGH PRIORITY REMAINING TASKS:

### 1. **Neural Network Method Signature Fix** ðŸš¨
   - train! method in neural_network.jl has signature mismatch
   - Current: train!(model::NeuralNetwork, X::Matrix, y::Vector)
   - Expected: train!(model::NeuralNetwork, data::Dict)
   - Blocking neural network training functionality

### 2. **Feature Groups Integration**
   - Parsing functionality complete in dataloader.jl:152-164
   - Integration needed in pipeline.jl and models.jl
   - Will improve model performance with proper feature grouping

### 3. **Multi-Target Training Support**
   - V5 dataset has multiple targets, currently only using primary
   - Requires neural network architecture changes
   - Will unlock more sophisticated modeling capabilities

## ðŸ”§ MEDIUM PRIORITY TASKS:

### 1. **Complete Test Placeholders**
   - test_retry.jl:654 has incomplete test implementation
   - Need to finish retry mechanism testing

### 2. **Cross-Platform Notifications**
   - Currently macOS only, need Linux/Windows support
   - Add notification throttling and rich formatting

## ðŸ”® FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

### 1. **Extended API Features**
   - Leaderboard access integration
   - Historical performance trends
   - Webhook management capabilities

### 2. **TUI Configuration System**
   - Replace hardcoded values with user settings
   - Persistent configuration management
   - Customizable refresh intervals and display limits
