# Numerai Tournament System - Implementation Status

## Project Status: STABLE v0.1.8 ✅

### Recently Completed (Critical Production Fixes)
1. ✅ Fixed UTC timezone handling across entire codebase
2. ✅ Fixed tournament schedule (Tuesday-Saturday per Numerai specs)
3. ✅ Added submission window validation (60hr weekend, 30hr daily)
4. ✅ Implemented MMC (Meta Model Contribution) local calculation
5. ✅ Implemented TC (True Contribution) local calculation
6. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage with 599 test cases across 9 test suites
7. ✅ All tests currently passing (42 end-to-end tests + unit tests)
8. ✅ Full ML pipeline with XGBoost, LightGBM, and EvoTrees integration
9. ✅ NMR staking write operations (stake placement/modification)
10. ✅ Automatic earnings compounding system

## Immediate Priorities

### Critical Issues (None Found)
- No critical bugs or blocking issues identified
- All core functionality operational
- Test suite passing without failures

### Enhancement Opportunities

#### High Priority
1. **CLI Integration Testing**
   - **Gap**: Command-line argument parsing not covered in test suite
   - **Risk**: CLI interface changes could break without detection

#### Medium Priority
3. **Default Model Configuration Enhancement**
   - **File**: `/src/NumeraiTournament.jl` lines 54-57
   - **Current**: Empty model array in default config
   - **Enhancement**: Provide sensible default model configurations

4. **TUI Model Details Panel**
   - **File**: `/src/tui/dashboard.jl` around lines 865-867
   - **Enhancement**: Interactive model details view (Enter key navigation)

#### Low Priority
5. **Advanced Features**
   - Enhanced reputation scoring algorithms
   - Proactive stake burn warning system
   - Full MLJ.jl framework integration
   - TUI wizard parameter adjustment with arrow keys
