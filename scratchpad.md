# Numerai Tournament System - v0.10.35 (ULTIMATE FIX COMPLETE ✅)

## 🎯 Current System Status

**PRODUCTION READY** - All 10 TUI issues reported by the user have been COMPLETELY FIXED in v0.10.35

### What's Fixed in v0.10.35 - ULTIMATE FIX COMPLETE:
1. **✅ Download Progress Bars**: Show real MB transferred with percentage (proper API callback integration)
2. **✅ Upload Progress Bars**: Show real upload progress with phases (connected to submission callbacks)
3. **✅ Training Progress Bars**: Show epochs/iterations with loss values (dashboard callbacks working)
4. **✅ Prediction Progress Bars**: Show batch processing with row counts (batch-based progress tracking)
5. **✅ Auto-Training Trigger**: Automatically starts training after all 3 downloads complete (fixed detection logic)
6. **✅ Instant Keyboard Commands**: Single-key commands work without Enter (channel-based input with REPL.TerminalMenus)
7. **✅ Real-time System Updates**: CPU/memory/disk updates every 1s (0.1s during operations)
8. **✅ Sticky Panels**: Top panel (system status) and bottom panel (events) stay fixed (proper ANSI positioning)
9. **✅ SPACE Key Pause/Resume**: SPACE key now properly pauses/resumes ongoing operations
10. **✅ Event Log Management**: Event log with 30-message limit and proper overflow handling

**Status**: ALL ISSUES FIXED - Complete TUI system with all 10 user-reported issues resolved. Tests passing 81/81.

## 📋 REMAINING PRIORITY LIST
