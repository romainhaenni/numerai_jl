# Numerai Tournament System - Development Tracker

## 🚨 HIGH PRIORITY TASKS (Active Issues):

### 1. **TabNet Implementation**
   - ⚠️ Simplified implementation - not true TabNet architecture
   - ❌ Missing attention mechanism and step-wise processing  
   - ❌ Current implementation is basic MLP disguised as TabNet
   - **VERIFIED**: Comment in code states "This is a simplified version - full TabNet is more complex"

### 2. **TUI Configuration Management**
   - ❌ Hardcoded values throughout TUI dashboard:
     - `refresh_rate = 1.0` (hardcoded)
     - `model_update_interval = 30.0` (hardcoded)
     - `network_check_interval = 60.0` (hardcoded)  
     - `sleep(0.1)` and `sleep(0.001)` (hardcoded)
     - `timeout=5` for network checks (hardcoded)
   - ❌ Need config.toml settings for TUI parameters
   - **VERIFIED**: Multiple hardcoded timing values in `/Users/romain/src/Numerai/numerai_jl/src/tui/dashboard.jl`


## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

### 1. **Advanced Features**
   - Webhook management capabilities
   - Advanced portfolio optimization strategies
   - Real-time model performance tracking

### 2. **Better TabNet Implementation**
   - True attention mechanism implementation
   - Step-wise feature selection
