## 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY TASKS:

### 1. **Hyperparameter Optimization - MISSING** 
   - ❌ NO hyperparameter optimization module exists
   - ❌ Models use hardcoded default parameters
   - ❌ No grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization
   - **Impact**: Severely limits model performance potential


## 🔧 HIGH PRIORITY TASKS:

### 1. **API Coverage Gaps** (Non-Critical Missing Endpoints)
   - ❌ Leaderboard endpoints missing (analytics/historical only)
   - ❌ Diagnostics endpoints missing (non-essential)
   - ❌ Historical data endpoints missing (analytics only)
   - ✅ Core tournament functionality complete and working
   - **Impact**: Limited only for advanced analytics, core operations work


### 2. **Test Suite Minor Issues**
   - ✅ Excellent coverage: 1410/1412 tests passing (99.86% pass rate)
   - ❌ Only 2 timing-related test failures in logger module
   - ✅ Individual model tests comprehensive
   - **Impact**: Minimal - only timing-sensitive tests failing


## 🔧 MEDIUM PRIORITY TASKS:

### 1. **Cross-Platform Notifications**
   - Currently macOS only, need Linux/Windows support
   - Add notification throttling and rich formatting


## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

### 1. **Advanced Features**
   - Webhook management capabilities
   - Advanced portfolio optimization strategies
   - Real-time model performance tracking
