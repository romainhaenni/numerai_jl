# Numerai Tournament System - Status Report (v0.9.9)

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

**SYSTEM IS PRODUCTION READY** - All critical issues have been resolved and the system is fully functional with proper API authentication and TUI operations.

## ðŸ”‘ Authentication Status - WORKING

The authentication system is **FULLY OPERATIONAL** with proper API communication established:
- âœ… API endpoint properly configured with `/graphql` path
- âœ… Authorization headers correctly set for all requests
- âœ… Full API test suite passing (13/13 tests)
- âœ… Credential validation working properly

## âœ… Completed Features

- **Tournament Pipeline**: Complete workflow (download â†’ train â†’ predict â†’ submit)
- **Model Implementations**: 9 model types including XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks
- **GPU Acceleration**: Metal support for M-series chips
- **Database System**: SQLite persistence for predictions and metadata
- **Scheduling System**: Tournament automation and timing
- **TUI Dashboard**: Redesigned unified panel with complete keyboard functionality
  - âœ… All keyboard shortcuts working (n, /, h, r, s, q)
  - âœ… System and network status display
  - âœ… Model performance metrics with round information
  - âœ… System resource usage with progress bars
  - âœ… Recent events log
  - âœ… Command help at bottom
  - âœ… Test coverage for keyboard handling

## ðŸ”§ Known Limitations

- **TC Calculation**: Uses correlation-based approximation instead of gradient-based method

## ðŸ“‹ System Components

- **TUI Dashboard**: Interactive terminal interface with unified panel design and real-time monitoring
- **Entry Point**: `./numerai` script provides main system access
- **Command System**: Fully functional dashboard commands and navigation

## ðŸš€ Enhancement Opportunities

While all critical functionality is working, these improvements could enhance the user experience:

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Further GPU acceleration opportunities
   - Memory usage optimizations for large datasets
   - Caching strategies for repeated operations

2. **Feature Additions**
   - Advanced ensemble methods
   - Enhanced visualization capabilities
   - Additional model types and ensemble strategies
