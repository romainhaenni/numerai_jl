## REMAINING IMPLEMENTATION TASKS

### P2: Major Feature Gaps üîß
- ‚ùå **TabNet Architecture Implementation**
  - Current: Simplified MLP version (not real TabNet)

## üîß KNOWN LIMITATIONS & AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:

### 1. **TabNet Architecture** ‚ö†Ô∏è **SIMPLIFIED**
   - Current implementation is basic MLP, not true TabNet
   - Missing: Attention mechanism, feature selection, decision steps
   - Code comment confirms: "This is a simplified version - full TabNet is more complex"
   - **Impact**: Functional but not optimal TabNet architecture

### 2. **TC (True Contribution) Calculation** ‚ö†Ô∏è **APPROXIMATED**
   - Uses correlation-based approximation vs official gradient-based method
   - Functional for basic TC estimation but may differ from Numerai's exact calculation
   - **Impact**: Provides reasonable TC estimates for model evaluation

### 3. **Advanced API Analytics Endpoints** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MISSING**
   - Leaderboard data retrieval endpoints
   - Model diagnostics and detailed performance analytics
   - Historical performance trend analysis
   - **Priority**: Low - non-essential for core functionality

### 4. **Multi-Target XGBoost Model** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**
   - XGBoost currently uses only the first target for multi-target scenarios
   - Simplified from multiple model types to focus on XGBoost optimization
   - Future enhancement could implement multiple XGBoost instances (one per target)

### 5. **Neural Networks** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REMOVED FOR SIMPLIFICATION**

### Implementation Summary

### Core Infrastructure Changes

1. **MLPipeline Enhanced for Multi-Target Support**
   - Updated `MLPipeline` struct to accept `target_col` as either `String` (single target) or `Vector{String}` (multi-target)
   - Added `is_multi_target::Bool` and `n_targets::Int` fields for tracking configuration
   - Automatic detection of single vs. multi-target based on input type
   - Full backward compatibility maintained for existing single-target workflows

2. **Data Preparation Functions**
   - Enhanced `prepare_data()` function to handle multiple target columns
   - Returns `Vector{Float64}` for single targets (backward compatible)
   - Returns `Matrix{Float64}` for multi-target with shape `(n_samples, n_targets)`
   - Proper era and feature handling for both configurations

3. **XGBoost Model Configuration** (Simplified)
   - Streamlined from multiple neural network architectures to single XGBoost model
   - XGBoost configured for optimal tournament performance
   - Simplified training and prediction pipeline
   - Removed complex neural network dependencies

4. **Prediction System** (Simplified)
   - Updated prediction functions to handle both single and multi-target outputs
   - Streamlined from ensemble to single XGBoost model approach
   - Maintains backward compatibility with existing single-target workflows
   - Simplified data flow without ensemble complexity

   - Modified prediction functions to return appropriate data types
   - Added multi-target support checks and warnings

### Current Status

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Implemented**: XGBoost uses only first target for multi-target scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Simplified**: Removed ensemble predictions and neural networks for streamlined approach

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. Automatic Target Detection
```julia
# Single target (backward compatible)
pipeline = MLPipeline(target_col="target_cyrus_v4_20")

# Multi-target (new V5 support)
pipeline = MLPipeline(target_col=["target_v5_a", "target_v5_b", "target_v5_c"])
```

### 2. Smart Data Preparation
```julia
# Returns Vector{Float64} for single target
X, y, eras = prepare_data(single_pipeline, df)  # y: Vector

# Returns Matrix{Float64} for multi-target
X, y, eras = prepare_data(multi_pipeline, df)   # y: Matrix (samples √ó targets)
```

### 3. Flexible Training
```julia
# Training automatically adapts to target type
train!(pipeline, train_df, val_df)

# Multi-target validation shows per-target and average correlations
# "Validation correlations: [0.1234, 0.2345, 0.3456]"
# "Average correlation: 0.2345"
```

### 4. XGBoost Predictions
```julia
# Returns appropriate type based on pipeline configuration
predictions = predict(pipeline, test_df)
# Single target: Vector{Float64}
# Multi-target: Matrix{Float64} (samples √ó targets)
```

### Usage Examples
```julia
# Single target (V4 - backward compatible)
pipeline = MLPipeline(target_col="target_cyrus_v4_20")

# Multi-target (V5 support)
pipeline = MLPipeline(target_col=["target_v5_a", "target_v5_b", "target_v5_c"])
```

### Key Features (Simplified)
- Automatic target detection and configuration
- Smart data preparation with appropriate return types
- Flexible XGBoost training that adapts to target structure
- Enhanced validation showing per-target and average correlations
- Memory-efficient single-model processing

This simplified implementation provides a streamlined foundation for handling V5 datasets while preserving all existing V4 functionality with reduced complexity.
