# Numerai Tournament System - Implementation Roadmap

## Project Status: PRODUCTION-READY v0.3.0 ‚úÖ

### Current Production System
**v0.3.0** is a comprehensive enterprise-grade system featuring:
- **GPU-accelerated ML training** with Metal.jl optimization for M4 Max
- **Deep learning framework** with Flux.jl (MLP, ResNet, TabNet architectures)
- **400+ comprehensive tests** with full coverage of critical systems
- **Production-grade security** with all critical bugs and vulnerabilities resolved
- **Complete ML pipeline** (XGBoost, LightGBM, EvoTrees) with V5 dataset support
- **SQLite persistence** with comprehensive logging and error recovery
- **Full TUI interface** with enhanced navigation and real-time updates

## Technical Issues Identified - Immediate Attention Required

### üêõ Critical Issues Found
1. **TC Calculation Bug - FIXED ‚úÖ** 
   - Critical bug in `quantile_normal_approx` function causing inverted TC signs has been resolved
   - System now correctly calculates True Contribution metrics

2. **Neural Network Feature Importance - NEEDS WORK ‚ö†Ô∏è**
   - Currently uses placeholder random values (line 799 in `neural_networks.jl`)
   - Requires proper implementation of gradient-based or permutation importance
   - Status: Placeholder implementation affecting model interpretability

3. **Neural Network Model Persistence - NOT IMPLEMENTED ‚ùå**
   - Save/load functionality missing for neural networks
   - Models cannot be persisted between sessions
   - Critical for production deployment and model reuse

4. **GPU Memory Monitoring - PLACEHOLDER ‚ö†Ô∏è**
   - Returns hardcoded values instead of actual Metal.jl memory stats
   - Waiting for Metal.jl API stability improvements
   - Affects GPU resource optimization

## Next Priority - v0.4.0 Development Focus

### üéØ Immediate Next Steps
1. **Neural Network Feature Importance** - Implement proper gradient-based importance calculation
2. **Neural Network Model Persistence** - Add save/load functionality for Flux.jl models
3. **Production Deployment Infrastructure** - Containerization and CI/CD pipeline
4. **Multi-Model Ensemble System** - Advanced model combination strategies
