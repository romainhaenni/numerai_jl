# Numerai Tournament System - Status Report (v0.10.11)

## 🎯 Current Status

**TUI FIXES IMPLEMENTED - REQUIRES REAL-WORLD TESTING** - The TUI issues have been addressed with the new TUIEnhanced module, but these fixes need validation with actual tournament data operations before the system can be considered fully production ready.

## 🔑 Authentication Status - WORKING

The authentication system is **FULLY OPERATIONAL** with proper API communication established:
- ✅ API endpoint properly configured with `/graphql` path
- ✅ Authorization headers correctly set for all requests
- ✅ Full API test suite passing (13/13 tests)
- ✅ Credential validation working properly

## ✅ Completed Features

- **Tournament Pipeline**: Complete workflow (download → train → predict → submit)
- **Model Implementations**: 9 model types including XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Networks
- **GPU Acceleration**: Metal support for M-series chips
- **Database System**: SQLite persistence for predictions and metadata
- **Scheduling System**: Tournament automation and timing
- **TUI Dashboard**: **FIXES IMPLEMENTED - NEEDS TESTING** - TUI issues addressed with TUIEnhanced module (v0.10.11)
  - 🔧 **TUI Issues Addressed (v0.10.11)**:
    - 🔧 Progress bars - New TUIEnhanced module provides proper progress display for downloads, uploads, training, and predictions
    - 🔧 Instant keyboard commands - Implemented via TUIEnhanced.setup_instant_commands!() without Enter key requirement
    - 🔧 Automatic training after download - Added TUIEnhanced.enable_auto_training_after_download!()
    - 🔧 Real-time status updates - Adaptive refresh rates (0.2s during operations, 1.0s idle)
    - 🔧 Enhanced sticky panels - Top panel for system info, bottom panel shows latest 30 events with color coding
    - 🔧 Progress tracker callbacks - Fixed parameter naming and integrated with TUIEnhanced
  - ⚠️ **REQUIRES REAL-WORLD VALIDATION** - These fixes need testing with actual tournament data operations

## 🔧 Known Limitations

- **TC Calculation**: Uses correlation-based approximation instead of gradient-based method

## 📋 System Components
