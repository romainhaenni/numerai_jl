   - ✅ Updated to expected signature: train!(model::NeuralNetwork, data::Dict)
   - ✅ Neural network training functionality fully operational


## 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY TASKS:

### 1. **Feature Groups - Partial Implementation** (75% Complete)
   - ✅ XGBoost integration working with interaction constraints
   - ✅ LightGBM and EvoTrees basic support implemented
   - ❌ CatBoost model NOT IMPLEMENTED (missing from codebase)
   - ❌ Linear model NOT IMPLEMENTED (missing from codebase)
   - ❌ Symbol/String conversion error in metadata loading needs fixing
   - **Impact**: XGBoost works, other models fail with feature groups

### 2. **Hyperparameter Optimization - MISSING** 
   - ❌ NO hyperparameter optimization module exists
   - ❌ Models use hardcoded default parameters
   - ❌ No grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization
   - **Impact**: Severely limits model performance potential

### 3. **Missing Model Implementations**
   - ❌ CatBoost model completely missing from ML pipeline
   - ❌ Linear model completely missing from ML pipeline
   - ✅ XGBoost, LightGBM, EvoTrees, NeuralNetwork implemented
   - **Impact**: Reduces model diversity and ensemble capabilities


## 🔧 HIGH PRIORITY TASKS:

### 1. **API Coverage Gaps** (13 Missing Endpoints)
   - ❌ Leaderboard endpoints missing (critical for competitive analysis)
   - ❌ Diagnostics endpoints missing (important for model health)
   - ❌ Historical data endpoints missing (limits backtesting)
   - ✅ Core submission/model management working
   - **Impact**: Limited data access for advanced analytics

### 2. **TUI Dashboard Gaps** (80-85% Complete)
   - ✅ Main dashboard, model status, tournament info working
   - ❌ Progress tracking during training missing
   - ❌ Some chart features incomplete
   - ❌ Real-time model training visualization needs enhancement
   - **Impact**: Reduced user experience during long training sessions

### 3. **ML Pipeline Testing Gaps**
   - ✅ Individual model tests comprehensive
   - ❌ End-to-end ML pipeline integration tests sparse
   - ❌ Feature group integration testing incomplete
   - **Impact**: Integration issues may surface in production


## 🔧 MEDIUM PRIORITY TASKS:

### 1. **Monitoring System Architecture**
   - ❌ No centralized monitoring.jl module
   - ✅ Monitoring functionality distributed across modules
   - Need to consolidate and enhance monitoring capabilities

### 2. **Cross-Platform Notifications**
   - Currently macOS only, need Linux/Windows support
   - Add notification throttling and rich formatting


## 🔮 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

### 1. **Advanced Features**
   - Webhook management capabilities
   - Advanced portfolio optimization strategies
   - Real-time model performance tracking

### 2. **TUI Configuration System**
   - Replace hardcoded values with user settings
   - Persistent configuration management
   - Customizable refresh intervals and display limits


## 📊 CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY:
- **Production Ready**: Core functionality, TC calculation, neural networks
- **Near Complete**: Feature groups (XGBoost working), TUI dashboard
- **Critical Gaps**: Hyperparameter optimization, missing models, API coverage
- **Test Quality**: Excellent (1410/1412 tests passing)
- **Architecture**: Solid foundation, needs optimization and completion of missing components
