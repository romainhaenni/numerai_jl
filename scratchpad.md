## CURRENT ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### ❌ Test Failure: Feature Groups Key Missing
**Location**: `/Users/romain/src/Numerai/numerai_jl/test/test_production_ready.jl:233`
**Issue**: Test expects `haskey(feature_data, "feature_groups")` but this key doesn't exist in the JSON file
**Root Cause**: The test is checking for a key "feature_groups" but the actual data structure in `/Users/romain/src/Numerai/numerai_jl/data/features.json` contains different keys:
- ✅ "feature_sets" (exists and is being tested correctly)
- ❌ "feature_groups" (missing - test expects this but file doesn't have it)
- Available keys in JSON: "feature_sets", "small", "medium", "all", "v2_equivalent_features", "v3_equivalent_features", "fncv3_features", "intelligence", "charisma", "strength", etc.

**Solution Needed**: Either:
1. Add missing "feature_groups" key to the JSON file with appropriate data, OR
2. Update the test to check for an existing key that makes sense for the application

**Status**: Identified - requires decision on data structure vs test expectation
