# Numerai Tournament System - v0.10.31 (TUI FULLY OPERATIONAL)

## 🎯 Current System Status

**SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL** - TUI now connected to real API/ML operations

## 📋 REMAINING PRIORITY LIST

### MEDIUM: Additional TUI Features
- ❌ Model Performance panel with real metrics from database
- ❌ Staking Status panel showing actual stake amounts
- ❌ Additional keyboard shortcuts (n for new model, p for performance, s for stake, h for help)
- ❌ 6-column grid layout optimization
- ❌ Proper event log color coding

### LOW: Polish and Cleanup
- ❌ Remove duplicate TUI modules (tui_fixed.jl, tui_ultimate_fix.jl, etc.)
- ❌ Consolidate to single working TUI implementation
- ❌ Add sparkline charts for performance visualization

## 📋 System Status

### Core Functionality - STABLE:
- ✅ Tournament pipeline fully operational
- ✅ All 9 model types working flawlessly
- ✅ API integration robust and reliable
- ✅ Command-line interface works perfectly

### TUI System - FULLY OPERATIONAL:
- ✅ Real API operations connected (download/train/submit)
- ✅ Real progress tracking with actual MB transferred
- ✅ Real ML training with epochs/iterations from models
- ✅ Real submission progress to Numerai API
- ✅ Auto-training triggers with real data after downloads
- ✅ Visual TUI layout and panels render correctly
- ✅ Instant single-key commands (d/t/p/s/r/q) work without Enter
- ✅ Real-time system CPU/memory/disk updates
- ✅ Event log with timestamps and formatting
- ✅ Sticky panels with proper ANSI positioning

## ✅ COMPLETED ISSUES

### CRITICAL Issues - RESOLVED:
- ✅ TUI now uses real API/ML operations (not simulated)
- ✅ Downloads show real progress with actual MB transferred
- ✅ Training shows real epochs/iterations from ML models
- ✅ Uploads show real submission progress to Numerai API
- ✅ Auto-training triggers with real data after downloads
- ✅ Replaced all `sleep()` simulation calls with actual operation monitoring
- ✅ Connected TUI to `API.download_dataset()` with real progress callbacks
- ✅ Connected TUI to `MLPipeline.train!()` with real training progress hooks
- ✅ Connected TUI to `API.submit_predictions()` with real submission progress

### HIGH Priority Issues - RESOLVED:
- ✅ Progress bars show real operation progress (no longer simulated)
- ✅ Auto-training after downloads triggers real training pipeline
- ✅ System status updates with real metrics
- ✅ Commands work instantly without Enter (was already working)
