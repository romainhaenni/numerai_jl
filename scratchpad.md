# Numerai Tournament System - v0.10.32 (TUI FULLY OPERATIONAL)

## 🎯 Current System Status

**SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL** - TUI now addresses ALL reported issues with real API/ML operations

## 📋 REMAINING PRIORITY LIST

### MEDIUM: Additional TUI Features
- ❌ Model Performance panel with real metrics from database
- ❌ Staking Status panel showing actual stake amounts
- ❌ Additional keyboard shortcuts (n for new model, p for performance, s for stake, h for help)
- ❌ 6-column grid layout optimization
- ❌ Proper event log color coding

### LOW: Polish and Cleanup
- ❌ Remove duplicate TUI modules (tui_fixed.jl, tui_ultimate_fix.jl, etc.)
- ❌ Consolidate to single working TUI implementation
- ❌ Add sparkline charts for performance visualization

## 📋 System Status

### Core Functionality - STABLE:
- ✅ Tournament pipeline fully operational
- ✅ All 9 model types working flawlessly
- ✅ API integration robust and reliable
- ✅ Command-line interface works perfectly

### TUI System - FULLY OPERATIONAL:
- ✅ Real API operations connected (download/train/submit)
- ✅ Real progress tracking with actual MB transferred and callbacks
- ✅ Real ML training with epochs/iterations from models
- ✅ Real submission progress to Numerai API with upload callbacks
- ✅ Auto-training triggers with real data after all 3 downloads complete
- ✅ Visual TUI layout and panels render correctly
- ✅ Instant single-key commands (d/t/p/s/r/q) work without Enter using raw TTY mode
- ✅ Real-time system CPU/memory/disk updates every 100ms during ops, 1s otherwise
- ✅ Event log with timestamps and formatting (last 30 messages with auto-overflow)
- ✅ Sticky top and bottom panels with proper ANSI positioning
- ✅ Non-blocking keyboard input for instant command execution
- ✅ Clean screen clearing and visual layout management

## ✅ COMPLETED ISSUES

### CRITICAL Issues - RESOLVED (v0.10.32):
- ✅ TUI now uses real API/ML operations (not simulated)
- ✅ Downloads show real progress with actual MB transferred
- ✅ Training shows real epochs/iterations from ML models
- ✅ Uploads show real submission progress to Numerai API
- ✅ Auto-training triggers with real data after all 3 downloads complete
- ✅ Replaced all `sleep()` simulation calls with actual operation monitoring
- ✅ Connected TUI to `API.download_dataset()` with real progress callbacks
- ✅ Connected TUI to `MLPipeline.train!()` with real training progress hooks
- ✅ Connected TUI to `API.submit_predictions()` with real submission progress

### HIGH Priority Issues - RESOLVED (v0.10.32):
- ✅ Progress bars show real operation progress with callbacks (no longer simulated)
- ✅ Auto-training after downloads triggers real training pipeline
- ✅ System status updates with real metrics (CPU, memory, disk, uptime)
- ✅ Commands work instantly without Enter using raw TTY mode
- ✅ TUI status information updates every 100ms during operations, 1s otherwise
- ✅ Sticky top panel with real-time system info
- ✅ Sticky bottom panel with event log showing last 30 messages
- ✅ Non-blocking keyboard input for instant command execution
- ✅ Progress bars/spinners for training operations show real epochs/iterations
- ✅ Progress bars/spinners for prediction operations are implemented
