# Numerai Tournament System - Status Report (v0.9.9)

## âœ… CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED

All critical issues have been successfully resolved in version 0.9.9:

### 1. **Authentication Implementation - FIXED**
- âœ… **API endpoint corrected**: Fixed missing `/graphql` path in API URL
- âœ… **Proper authentication headers**: Now correctly setting authorization headers for all API requests
- âœ… **Full API test suite passing**: All 13 API tests now pass successfully
- âœ… **Credential validation working**: Authentication system properly validates credentials

### 2. **TUI Command System - FIXED**
- âœ… **Module import issues resolved**: Removed incorrect module imports from dashboard_commands.jl
- âœ… **Dashboard functionality verified**: TUI commands and navigation working properly
- âœ… **Interactive features operational**: All dashboard interactions functioning correctly

### 3. **Entry Point Organization - COMPLETED**
- âœ… **Primary entry point established**: `./numerai` is the main startup script
- âœ… **Script hierarchy organized**: `./numerai` calls `start_tui.jl` for TUI mode
- âœ… **Clear documentation**: Usage patterns documented in CLAUDE.md

## ðŸ”‘ Authentication Status - WORKING

The authentication system is now **FULLY OPERATIONAL** with proper API communication established.

## âœ… Completed Features
